# RaspberryPiSmartRemote
An IOT Raspberry Pi Smart Remote

I may be using this [tutorial](http://alexba.in/blog/2013/02/23/controlling-lirc-from-the-web/)

Also [this library](https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_node) looks very interesting to use.

I am also going to create a server to keep a connection with the RaspberryPi so that it will be accessible outside the home network.

I also hope to be able to connect other services (such as FB messenger or Google Assistant) to the server.s
